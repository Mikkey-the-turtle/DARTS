Here, in the Supplementary folder, are presented both Supplementary files (Supplementary Figure 1 & Supplementary Tables 1 .tar.gz archieve) 
and additional files from the same results produced as a part of DARTS issue ().

Supplementary Figure 1 & Supplementary Tables 1 archieve are put in the root of "Supplementary" folder.
Folder "Additional_files" carries 4 folders with the main outputs from each of 4 studied genomes for each way of LTR-retrotransposon searching and annotating.

There are file types should be presented:
1. "(%genome_name).fa_elements" (example - Athal.fa_elements) - FASTA file of nucleotide sequences of found elements.
2. "(%domain_type)_(%genome_name).fa_elements.faa" (GAG_Athal.fa_elements.faa) - FASTA file of amino acid sequences of %domain_type found in all elements from previous file (1.). Altogether, there are 6 domains - GAG (gag polyprotein), PRo (Protease), RT (reverse transcriptase, annotated as gRT), RNH (ribonuclease H, annotated as gRH), INT (integrase) and aRNH (additional/archaeal RNH, annotated as aRH). 
3. folder "mmseq2-80" with the same files as it was in 2., but only from representative elements from each cluster after clusterisation.
4. "Natural_table" - processed mmseq2 output table of clusters (all chimeric elements excluded, better representative elements chosen).
5. "coordinates_table_of_(%genome_name).fa_elements" - BAS-like file, where for each element found the following information is presented: 1) contig from assembly, 2-3) start and end coordinates for 4) LTR1/LTR2/internal (domain-containing part), 5)element annotation and 6) stand (+/-).

! If the file of genome assembly was split, DARTS produces such coordinates file (type 5) for each sub-file in splitted batch.


"toy_example..." is a folder with all resulted files after DARTS pipeline processed the Arabidopsis thaliana genome assembly, starting from RT domain.
